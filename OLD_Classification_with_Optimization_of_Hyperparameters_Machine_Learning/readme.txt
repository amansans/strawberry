About the project:

# Split the data set into test and train data using scikit-learn
# Upload the data sets locally as they are confidential and cannot be shared
# Perform basic data preprocessing to smoothen the data
# Perform classification for CV values from 1 to 10
# Apply RF, RBF, MLP, k-NN, and DT and tune the hyperparameters
# Obtain accuracy and f1-scoreg them
