- Used JPA's abstract functions and native code to build SQL queries and tested them using Junit, Mockito and Postman.
- Built front end services, components, and routing mechanisms using Angular.
- Used HTML and CSS to build the webpage UI and integrated it with angular components to allow communication with the SQL database.
